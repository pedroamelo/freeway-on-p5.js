# freeway-on-p5.js
Hello! So happy to have you here! Please enjoy the game that I made on P5.js!
To run the game you need to install the p5.vscode on your VS Code or any p5.js extension in your code editor and add the folder of this project as a p5.js project and go live.
Hope you have fun!

Thanks to benmorern for the 2d collide interactions, you can check some of his work here: http://benmoren.com

Please feel free to give me any feedback to improve my code, I discovered a recently new passion for coding and I'm aways looking to improve.

Without further ado, thank you!
